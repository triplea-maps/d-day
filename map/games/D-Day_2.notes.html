#Player AirNavySupport:
<br>

<br>
-Make para surprise attack without defensive german fire. Only 1st round. Cannot   
 target blockhouses.
<br>
(special disposable paraunits at arrows make attack, 1 round, then retreat. They are not used in rest of game anymore. The real para's on the ground (inf) act as regular inf. and can move and attack again in the allies turn.)
<br>     *The attack unfortunately targets blockhouses as well.
<br>

<br>
-Naval bombardment at blockhouses. 6 attacks are made, one after the other, Allies choose casualties. Each 2 is a hit. 
<br>
(Fire 6 disposable units at blockhouses. Retreat after 1 round. In Non-combat retreat all surviving units to be used the next turn.)
<br>     *Allies cannot fire one after the other and switch targets, must divide attacks in advance.
<br>

<br>
-2 Bombers make targeted attack. Allies choose casualties. 3 is hit. Cannot target territory with friendly units in it. Artillery (AA) will fire later, destroyed artillery cannot fire at bomber. 
<br>
(there are only 2 bombers in the game. They can only be killed by AA. If they die by regular combat each bomber is replaced from the stack. If they die by Artillery (AA) fire at a later stage they are not replaced.
<br>     *They players will have to remember if the bombers are subjected to AA fire.
<br>

<br>
-Fighters are placed on patrol. There can be up to 4 fighters in each territory. Each fighter fires at every unit that moves in or out of the territory at any time. 1 is a hit.
<br>
(The fighters are actually AA placed in a special territory within each territory. All units moving in or out of the territory have to pass through it. All ground units are actually air and subject to AA fire when moving in or out of the territory.)
<br>     *No more then 1 AA can fire in the game, so airpower can't be concentrated as the rules allow it. Could make new player with radar tech which would allow up to two fighters patrolling a territory. Actually one stronger fighter. Found no other way to get closer.
<br>

<br>
#GermansBlockhouseAA
<br>

<br>
-Each artillery within a territory subject to bomber attack or fighter patrol can fire one shot at air. 1 is hit. If both bomber attack and fighter patrol then each artillery fires at both.
<br>
(The player adds up the number of shots, buys and throws techdice. If there are shots at bombers the first dice are for the bombers.)
<br>     *Unfortunately casualties will have to be edited. Tried to add an extra movement turn for airnavysupport to allow him to move the casualties to the stack area. Couldn't get it working.
<br>

<br>
-Each blockhouse within range (red arrows) of allied reinforcements makes a targeted attack. Germans choose casualties. 3 is a hit.
<br>
(Disposable units are moved to the reinforcement area's(arrows). Surviving units retreat after one round to be used the next turn.) 
<br>

<br>
#Allies
<br>

<br>
-Move landunits on the continent, combat AND non-combat. In Non-combat step they are only allowed to retreat from battle to the same territory.
<br>
(All landterritories are divided in a German and Allies side.) 
<br>

<br>
-Land the units from the beachheads. They can move only one space, including the armour. No more than 8 Allied units (USA+UK) allowed per territory. If there is no room for all, the rest is left on the beachheads for next rounds. The landed units can engage in combat this turn.  
<br>

<br>
-Battle: only 1 round.
<br>

<br>
-Determine number of Allied reinforcements.
<br>
(Throw 4 tech dice. 1+2=number of USA reinf., 3+4=number of UK reinf.)
<br>

<br>
-Retreat all units from battle to own side of territory.
<br>
(Non-combat move)
<br>

<br>
-Place reinforcements on beachheads. No more than the amount indicated on each beachhead is allowed. Follow the special reinforcement-charts from left to right, top to bottom to determine the type of reinforcements. The charts also indicate where the units can be placed, so the first turn USA gets just up to four reinforcements on Utah beach only. 
<br>
(Non-combat move. The USA-chart is split in two. Follow first left half, then right.)  
<br>

<br>
#Germans
<br>

<br>
-Move landunits on the continent, combat AND non-combat. In Non-combat step they are only allowed to retreat from battle to the same territory.

<br>

<br>
-Determine number of German reinforcements.
<br>
(Throw 4 tech dice. 1+2=number of reinf. for Rennes/Chartres 3+4=number of reinf. for Rouen/Chartres)
<br>

<br>
-Retreat all units from battle to own side of territory.
<br>
(Non-combat move)
<br>

<br>

They are fired upon by fighters if any patrol the territory.
